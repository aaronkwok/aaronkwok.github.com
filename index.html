<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>
<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

<h3>The Gambler</h3><br>
On a warm summer's evening, on a train bound for nowhere<br>
I met up with the gambler, We were both too tired to sleep<br>
So we took turns a staring, out the window at the darkness<br>
When boredom overtook us, he began to speak<br><br>
He said: Son, I've made a life, out of reading people's faces<br>
Knowing what the cards were, by the way they held their eyes<br>
So if you don't mind my saying, I can see you're out of aces<br>
For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice<br><br>
So I handed him my bottle and, he drank down my last swallow<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette, and asked me for a light<br>
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression<br>
He said: If you're gonna play the game, you gotta learn to play it right<br><br>
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them<br>
Know when to walk away, know when to run<br>
You never count your money, when you're sitting at the table<br>
There'll be time enough for counting, when the dealing's done<br><br>
Every gambler knows that, the secret to surviving<br>
Is knowing what to throw away, and what to keep<br>
'Cause every hand's a winner, and every hand's a loser<br>
And the best that you can hope for is, to die in your sleep<br><br>
And when he finished speaking, he turned back toward the window<br>
Crushed out his cigarette, and faded off to sleep<br>
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even<br>
And in his final words I found, an ace that I could keep<br><br>
You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them<br>
Know when to walk away, know when to run<br>
You never count your money, when you're sitting at the table<br>
There'll be time enough for counting, when the dealing's done<br>
